# [vtlanglo.github.io](vtlanglo.github.io)

My personal website, built using Typescript and React. 

## Purpose

The website has the following goals:
1. Develop and design a website to showcase my skill sets.
2. Further develop the web development skills gained during my internship.
3. Highlight my experiences, education, and projects.

## Future

Following my graduation from Indiana University, I plan on overhauling my website. The following will be done:
1. Conduct a code review of the entire repository, noting errors and/or issues spotted for further review.
2. Design a UI redesign wireframe in Figma.
3. Add additional features, including but not limited to:
   1. Tag filtering system for my projects and completed courses, allowing users to see exactly what they want to see on both pages
   2. A proper contact page.
4. Conduct user testing on new features and UI/UX design choices

This overhaul will allow me to learn more about Typescript and React, alongside learn more about the following
- Figma
- UI/UX
- User testing
- Code reviews
- GitHub Issues and Project Boards
